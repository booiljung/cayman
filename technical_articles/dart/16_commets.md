##  Comments

Dart supports single-line comments, multi-line comments, and documentation comments.

###  Single-line comments

A single-line comment begins with `//`. Everything between `//` and the end of line is ignored by the Dart compiler.

```dart
void main() {
  // TODO: refactor into an AbstractLlamaGreetingFactory?
  print('Welcome to my Llama farm!');
}
```

###  Multi-line comments

A multi-line comment begins with `/*` and ends with `*/`. Everything between `/*` and `*/` is ignored by the Dart compiler (unless the comment is a documentation comment; see the next section). Multi-line comments can nest.

```dart
void main() {
  /*
   * This is a lot of work. Consider raising chickens.

  Llama larry = Llama();
  larry.feed();
  larry.exercise();
  larry.clean();
   */
}
```

###  Documentation comments

Documentation comments are multi-line or single-line comments that begin with `///` or `/**`. Using `///` on consecutive lines has the same effect as a multi-line doc comment.

Inside a documentation comment, the Dart compiler ignores all text unless it is enclosed in brackets. Using brackets, you can refer to classes, methods, fields, top-level variables, functions, and parameters. The names in brackets are resolved in the lexical scope of the documented program element.

Here is an example of documentation comments with references to other classes and arguments:

```dart
/// A domesticated South American camelid (Lama glama).
///
/// Andean cultures have used llamas as meat and pack
/// animals since pre-Hispanic times.
class Llama {
  String name;

  /// Feeds your llama [Food].
  ///
  /// The typical llama eats one bale of hay per week.
  void feed(Food food) {
    // ...
  }

  /// Exercises your llama with an [activity] for
  /// [timeLimit] minutes.
  void exercise(Activity activity, int timeLimit) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

In the generated documentation, `[Food]` becomes a link to the API docs for the Food class.

To parse Dart code and generate HTML documentation, you can use the SDKâ€™s [documentation generation tool.](https://github.com/dart-lang/dartdoc#dartdoc) For an example of generated documentation, see the [Dart API documentation.](https://api.dartlang.org/stable) For advice on how to structure your comments, see [Guidelines for Dart Doc Comments.](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/documentation)
